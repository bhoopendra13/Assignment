## General Information
- ##### To duild a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.
- ##### To build a Convolutional Neural Network based model to accurately detect Melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
- ##### Attempting to build a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma to potentially reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- ##### Dataset Description: The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

> The data set contains the following diseases:
- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
- seborrheic keratosis has the least number of samples?
- pigmented benign keratosis" and "melanoma" dominate the data in terms of number of samples.
